# Stranger Stats ðŸ§ªðŸ‘¾

Welcome to **Stranger Stats**, an introduction to data science through the world of *Stranger Things*!  
In this workshop, youâ€™ll explore monsters, characters, and Upside Down events using Python, pandas, and Colab.

## ðŸ•¹ Workshop Flow

There are **four notebooks** in this repo:

1. **01_Intro_Exercises.ipynb**  
   - Icebreaker: Dice probability exercises  
   - Hands-on introduction to Python, pandas, and Colab  
   - Build confidence with calling prebuilt functions

2. **02_Descriptive_Stats.ipynb**  
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, sum, etc.)  
  - Grouping and aggregating data  
  - Visualizations (bar charts, histograms)  
  - **Exercises include**:  
     - Sum and mean of monster sightings in each area  
     - Total number of monster sightings  
     - Average monster count in each area  
     - Activity counts by hour of the day  
     - Average severity of Upside Down events by monster  

3. **03_Integration_Exercises.ipynb**  
   - Combine datasets to explore relationships  
   - **Exercises include**:
     - Compare monster counts to character activity  
     - Correlation of monster count with Upside Down event severity  
     - Parameter tweaks: filter by hour, day, or severity level  
   - Encourages experimentation and exploration

4. **04_Final_Challenge_Hawkins.ipynb**  
   - The **Hawkins Mystery** challenge  
   - Merge all three sheets (Monster Sightings, Character Stats, Upside Down Events)  
   - Answer open-ended questions:
     - Which character is most likely to encounter a monster?  
     - Which day/hour is the most dangerous overall?  
     - Does monster count correlate with Upside Down event severity?  
   - Encourages critical thinking and integration of skills
